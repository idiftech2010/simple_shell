Simple Shell
This project is the most important of the first trimester of Holberton School, is the consolidation of everything we learned in the quarter about System engineering & DevOps and Low-level programming & Algorithm. Using C programming language, we develop our own Shell.

Description
The shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.
